# 🚀 POLLIN — AUTONOMOUS DEVELOPMENT MODE ACTIVATED

**Status:** Maximum Agency Mode Enabled  
**User Request:** Build full vision with minimal oversight  
**Your Role:** Review, test, provide feedback, approve releases

---

## 🎯 What This Means

I will autonomously develop, test, and document all features while you focus on:
- Testing locally
- Providing visual/UX feedback
- Making high-level decisions
- Reviewing at natural checkpoints

You don't need to run commands, copy files, or manage day-to-day development.

## 📊 Development Strategy

### How I Work:
1. **Develop autonomously** → Full feature development, testing, docs
2. **Commit incrementally** → Create files in `C:\Users\caespiritu\source\`
3. **Mark checkpoints** → "Feature X ready for review"
4. **Wait for feedback** → You test, provide input
5. **Iterate** → Refine based on your feedback
6. **Push to GitHub** → When you approve

### Your Role:
1. **Test locally** → Run `npm run dev`, try features
2. **Provide feedback** → "I like this", "Change that"
3. **Review code** → At major milestones
4. **Make decisions** → What to prioritize, design direction
5. **Approve releases** → When ready to push to GitHub

## ⏱️ Expected Timeline

| Phase | Features | Time | Status |
|-------|----------|------|--------|
| 0 | MVP canvas | ✅ DONE | Complete |
| 1 | Advanced canvas | 2–3 hrs | **IN PROGRESS** |
| 2 | Persistence | 2–3 hrs | Queued |
| 3 | References | 3–4 hrs | Queued |
| 4 | Design system ref | 2–3 hrs | Queued |
| 5 | Tests | 4–6 hrs | Queued |
| 6 | Storybook | 2–3 hrs | Queued |
| 7 | CI/CD | 2–3 hrs | Queued |
| 8–11 | API + collab + docs | 6–8 hrs | Queued |

**Total:** ~25–30 hours of autonomous development  
**Your time:** ~1–2 hours for testing/feedback

## 🔄 Checkpoint System

I will notify you at these checkpoints:

```
✅ Phase 1 Complete
   → "Advanced canvas ready for review"
   → You test: npm run dev
   → Provide feedback
   → I iterate

✅ Phase 2 Complete
   → "Persistence ready for review"
   → You test save/load/export
   → Feedback
   → I iterate

... and so on
```

---

## 📝 Communication

### I will send you:
- ✅ "Feature X ready for review"
- ✅ Summary of what changed
- ✅ How to test it
- ✅ Code diff (key changes)
- ✅ Ask for specific feedback

### You will reply with:
- ✅ Test results (works/broken)
- ✅ Visual/UX feedback
- ✅ Bugs or issues
- ✅ Feature requests
- ✅ Approval to proceed

---

## 🎯 Quality Standards

I commit to:
- ✅ All code fully typed (TypeScript strict)
- ✅ Accessible (WCAG AA)

## ✨ What You'll See

When I finish Phase 1, I'll create:

```
Advanced Canvas Features Ready for Review
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What's New:
  ✓ Zoom (scroll wheel: zoom in/out)
  ✓ Pan (middle-click drag or spacebar+drag)
  ✓ Grid overlay (toggle with button)
  ✓ Snap to grid (when enabled)
  ✓ Guide lines (horizontal/vertical)
  ✓ Undo/redo (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Shift+Z)
  ✓ Reference layers (show behind/in front)

Files Added/Modified:
  + src/hooks/useCanvasTransform.ts (new)
  + src/hooks/useHistory.ts (new)
  + src/components/GuidePanel.tsx (new)
  ✏️  src/components/Canvas.tsx (enhanced)
  ✏️  src/components/ControlPanel.tsx (updated)
  + Tests for all new features

How to Test:
  1. npm run dev
  2. Try scrolling on canvas (zoom)
  3. Enable grid (button in panel)
  4. Draw with grid (snap enabled)
  5. Try undo (Ctrl+Z)
  6. Test guides

Feedback Needed:
  - Does zoom feel responsive?
  - Is grid snapping too strict?
  - Should guides be more visible?
  - Any performance issues?
  - UX improvements?

Ready to proceed? Any changes before Phase 2?
```
