# Pollin

A web-based creative canvas for cross-pollinating design ideas, bringing together sketches, references, design systems, and UI concepts into a single, fluid workspace.

Inspired by tools like Stitch and Pencil, Pollin bridges the gap between exploration and production-ready UI.

## What Pollin Enables

🌱 **Cross-Pollinated Canvas**
- Spatial, freeform canvas for mixing ideas, references, and UI concepts
- Drag, cluster, and remix thoughts visually—no rigid frames required

🔗 **Connect Design Systems**
- Link or paste Figma files, libraries, and design system URLs
- Treat connected systems as live sources of truth, not static screenshots

✏️ **Sketch → UI**
- Freeform inking and sketching directly on the canvas
- Convert rough sketches into higher-fidelity UI components
- Progress naturally from napkin sketch → wireframe → polished interface

🖼 **Reference-Driven UI Creation**
- Drag and drop image references directly onto the canvas
- Right-click or prompt actions like "Make this" or "Turn this into UI"
- Translate visual inspiration into usable UI patterns

## Why Pollin

Pollin is not a whiteboard, and it's not a design tool replacement.
It's the connective tissue between inspiration, systems, and execution.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/butter-zone/pollin.git
cd pollin

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:5173`

### Scripts

```bash
npm run dev       # Start dev server with hot reload
npm run build     # Build for production
npm run preview   # Preview production build locally
npm run lint      # Check code with ESLint
npm run lint:fix  # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run format    # Format code with Prettier
npm run test      # Run unit tests with Vitest
```

## Standards

Pollin is built with strong standards for quality, security, and accessibility.

### Security

See `SECURITY.md` for baseline security expectations:
- **Cybersecurity** — Protecting systems
- **OPSEC** — Protecting information and behaviors
- **PERSEC** — Protecting people

### Accessibility

See `ACCESSIBILITY.md` for WCAG AA compliance:
- Semantic HTML and keyboard navigation
- Visible focus states and color contrast
- Screen reader support
- No color-only feedback

### Design System

See `DESIGN-TOKENS.md` for token definitions:
- Color roles (surface, accent)
- Typography scale
- Spacing scale
- Shadows and elevation

### Contributing

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution guidelines.

## Tech Stack

- **React 18** — UI framework
- **TypeScript** — Type safety
- **Vite** — Fast build tool and dev server
- **TailwindCSS** — Utility-first styling
- **Framer Motion** — Smooth animations
- **Canvas API** — Drawing surface
- **ESLint + Prettier** — Code quality

## Design Philosophy

- Design is nonlinear
- Ideas grow better together
- Systems should enable creativity, not constrain it
- Accessibility and security are non-negotiable
- Long-term maintainability over short-term trends

## Status

🚧 **Early-stage exploration and prototyping**  
📐 **Design-system-first mindset**  
♿ **Accessibility-aware by default**

## Control Panel Inspiration

The canvas includes a floating control panel by [Josh Puckett's DialKit](https://joshpuckett.me/dialkit), allowing real-time tuning of:
- Drawing tools (pen, eraser, select)
- Line width and color
- Canvas parameters

## Roadmap

- [ ] MVP canvas with sketching
- [ ] Floating control panel for tool tuning
- [ ] Design system reference integration
- [ ] Figma file import
- [ ] Collaboration features
- [ ] Export and persistence
- [ ] Mobile support
